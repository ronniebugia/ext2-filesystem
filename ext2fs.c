     filler: Pointer to a function that must be called for every entry

             the metadata of the file (optional, may be passed NULL),
             and an offset for the next call to ext2_readdir
             (optional, may be passed 0).
     offset: Will usually be 0. If a previous call to filler for the
             same path passed a non-zero value as the offset, this
             function will be called again with the provided value as

     fi: Not used in this implementation of readdir.

/* ext2_open: Function called when a process opens a file in the file

   Parameters:

         opened. Some useful fields include:
	 flags: Flags for opening the file. Check 'man 2 open' for

	 fh: File handle. The value you set to this handle will be
             passed unmodified to all other file operations involving
             the same file.
   Returns:
     In case of success, returns 0. In case of error, may return one

       -ENOENT: If the file does not exist;
       -EISDIR: If the path corresponds to a directory;

/* ext2_read: Function called when a process reads data from a file in

   than size+offset.
   
   Parameters:
     path: Path of the open file.
     buf: Pointer where data is expected to be stored.
     size: Maximum number of bytes to be read from the file.
     offset: Byte offset of the first byte to be read from the file.
     fi: Data structure containing information about the file being
         opened. This is the same structure used in ext2_open.
   Returns:
     In case of success, returns the number of bytes actually read
     from the file--which may be smaller than size, or even zero, if
     (and only if) offset+size is beyond the end of the file. In case
     of error, may return one of these error codes (not all of them
     are required):
       -ENOENT: If the file does not exist;
       -EISDIR: If the path corresponds to a directory;
